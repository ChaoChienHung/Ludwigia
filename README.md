# Ludwigia

Ludwigia is my personal website that serves as both a portfolio and a playground for learning essential web development skills. Through this project, I practice core frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap while building a space to introduce myself and showcase my work.

## Features

1. Home page with personal introduction and contact information  
2. Projects page featuring a carousel preview of selected work  
3. (Optional) Blog section for sharing thoughts and updates
